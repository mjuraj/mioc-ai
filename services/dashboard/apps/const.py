‚ÄúThe future of customer service builds on AI to deliver engaging experiences and generate lasting value.‚Äù (McKinsey,
2022)


Here are 4 main reasons why AI agents are the future:
1. Personalization
2. Proactivity
3. Expertise
4. Multi-platform integration


Personalization: ‚ÄúI know you‚Äù
In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, people expect technology to provide them with personalized and convenient experiences. In
the past, apps were the go-to solution for delivering these experiences. However, as technology evolves, a new player
is breaking through ‚Äî it‚Äôs better, smarter, more flexible, and better looking üòé. These intelligent creatures are
designed to learn from your previous interactions, preferences, and behaviors, providing you with increasingly relevant
and helpful advice. It‚Äôs like having a friend who knows you and reacts to your needs (and is not sarcastic).


Proactivity: ‚ÄúI care for you‚Äù
Unlike apps, which typically require the user to initiate an action, AI agents are proactive and can reach out to users
with relevant information or recommendations. For example, an AI agent could notify you of an upcoming event, or suggest
a product that might bring value to you. This can help you save time and effort, making the experience more seamless and
convenient. You could say AI agents are the ultimate wingman, always looking out for you and ensuring you get exactly
what you need when you need it.


Expertise: ‚ÄúI have the expertise‚Äù
AI agents can be built with specific expertise to solve particular problems. A financial AI agent could help you manage
your investments and retirement plan. A health AI agent could remind you to take medication, book doctor appointments,
etc. This can also be very useful, not only for complex issues or specialized industries but also for everyday
decisions, like choosing what to eat in a day (tough one).


Multi-platform integration
Finally, AI agents can be integrated across multiple platforms and apps, making them accessible to users wherever they
are. For example, a user could interact with an AI agent through WhatsApp, Telegram, E-mail, etc. This flexibility can
help users stay engaged with the AI agent, making it a more integral part of their daily routine. Guess we can agree
that checking WhatsApp is a daily habit for most of us while using an app requires much more effort (you must download
it, learn how to use it, and remember to check it out‚Ä¶) ‚Äî and who wants to put effort into something that should make
your life easier?
